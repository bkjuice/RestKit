    <summary>Resourceful is a very simple HTTP client that removes the need to re-write the boilerplate.</summary>
    <description>
      Resourceful can be as simple as Resource.Json{T}().Get(...uri). Simple variations exist for Xml and Text. 
      For more advanced scenarios, you can hook into a callback pipeline and also have full access to the underlying HttpClient.
      Use of Resourceful is testable using the IHttpResource{T} interface as an abstraction, and also via the well-known practice of injecting a mock HttpMessageHandler.
